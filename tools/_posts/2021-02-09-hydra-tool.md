### How it's used

Performers at [algoraves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorave) use Hydra to create experimental visual artwork in the browser, often accompanying live coded music. Hydra is based on JavaScript. You type in functions to alter the visuals, then press CTRL-Enter to run a line of code and see the results, or CTRL-Shift-Enter to run your entire program. By adding just a command or two or tweaking your variables, you'll see quickly changing results. 

The livecoding community is dispersed across the globe, with particular hotspots in London, Barcelona, New York and elsewhere. As Hydra is run in a web browser, it's also found a large community of internet users that meet up online for hangouts and online algoraves. There are a large number of tutorials in English, Spanish and other languages, and active forums to meet other Hydra users.

### How to get started

Hydra includes a number of small features that make it beginner-friendly. When you launch Hydra, close the initial info window and you'll see starter code shared by the global Hydra community. Try clicking on the die to randomize some of the variables and notice how that affects the visuals. You can also hit the shuffle button to get new example starter code. When you're ready to learn the language, check out some of the video tutorials, manuals, and additional shared programs.
