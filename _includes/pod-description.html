Artists and Hackers is a podcast on art, code and community. We talk to programmers, artists, poets, musicians, scholars, educators, musicians and designers in an effort to critically look at the tools of digital creation and a history of technology and the internet. We’re interested in where we’ve been and speculative ideas on the future.
