Property and Indigenous Knowledge</h3>
<p>Lee Tusman<br />
You’re listening to Artists and Hackers, a podcast on art, code and
community. We talk to programers, artist, poets, musicians, botmakers,
students, and now legal scholars in an effort to look at online
artmaking and a history of technology and the internet. We’re interested
in where we’ve been and speculative ideas on the future.</p>
<p>In this season of the podcast we’re working with the Engelberg Center
for Innovation Policy at NYU Law.</p>
<p>This season we’ve been examining the world of copyright and how it
relates to creative artworks and code, not because we’re interested in
property on its own but because we’re interested in how artists and
creators working on projects with current technology are running into
societal issues that may or may not be addressed by law. In our
interview with Michael Weinberg, Director of the Engelberg Center, he
spoke about the monkey selfie legal case and how copyright is grounded
in the idea that it’s a person that possess copyright.</p>
<p>Creative Commons Director Kat Walsh spoke on the creation of creative
commons as a hack on copyright when legislators wouldn’t step in to
support work created and dedicated to the public. In our interview with
programmer and artist Ramsey Nasser, he spoke about co-creating the
Anti-Capitalist Software License due to a need for open source software
licenses that do more to address the conditions of how software is
written, allowing individual programmers and coops to use one’s code for
example, but preventing a for-profit corporation from doing so. Creative
Commons and the Anti-Capitalist Software License are two responses to
perceived imbalances from copyright law, part of a community of folks
interested in ethics and open source. In today’s episode, we’re looking
at issues that come up in indigenous communities, and one initiative to
respond to the limitations of the law and to reassert cultural authority
in one’s own heritage, culture and data.</p>
<p>Jane Anderson<br />
My name is Jane Anderson.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
And Jane, what’s your area of specialty?</p>
<p>Jane<br />
My area of specialty I would probably say is intellectual property law
combined with questions of decolonization and histories of Museums And
Anthropology I guess.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
How did you get into working this way in this area?</p>
<p>Jane<br />
I began this work by doing a PHD in law in Australia around intellectual
property and indigenous knowledge. So I did a PHD in intellectual
property and indigenous knowledge particularly focusing on the way in
which intellectual property law had come to a subject of indigenous
knowledge. Particularly in relationship to aboriginal art and for me
that was a super interesting question particularly because it required
me to think about the history of intellectual property law. Its
emergence as a particular body of law as well as kind of how it was able
to or how it continues to bring in new kinds of subject matter as that
emerges right? So how does it protect digital technology. How does it
protect so it’s it’s fascinating to kind of think about. Such an old
body of law being able to consistently adapt to new social and cultural
innovations as they happen in order to either protect them or bring them
under its domain and I was interested in why it hadn’t. Thought about
aboriginal art and then when it did, how it responded.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
Okay, if I understood you right? for part of this. It sounds like and
correct me if I’m wrong in any of this. It sounds like you’re saying
that copyright law and and kind of other legal structures were able to
kind of absorb and deal with technology. And the ways that maybe artists
are working in this way but but but not so much able to kind of support
and work with kind of aboriginal knowledge and culture, is that
accurate?</p>
<p>Jane<br />
Yeah, yeah, so I was interested particularly in that work about how it
is that the law itself is functioning to create a particular kind of
subject or object that it then is able to protect and particularly was
interested in. Why you know in it. This is a really quite a specific
kind of question about why in 1970 in Australia did intellectual
property law or copyright in particular become concerned with the
framing of aboriginal artistry. And needing to bring it into a form of
protection when for you know, hundreds of years. It had never cared so
what was that tipping point of some you know and and then what did the
law need to do in order to bring aboriginal art under. It’s kind of
umbrella and to do that it needed to make aboriginal artists. It needed
to make an aboriginal artist so that wasn’t necessarily a given and it
also needed to identify aboriginal art as a particular kind of subject
matter or work that. Copyright law could protect and that also wasn’t
necessarily a given.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
And what did you find I’m curious like why did that become a priority
for legal structures to be able to kind of yeah identify Define an
aboriginal artist and to kind of support their work in a copyright
context.</p>
<p>Jane<br />
Well I think that the 1970s in Australia was a particular moment where
aboriginal activists were starting to say hey how come everybody is
copying our work and nobody recognizes us as artists and yet. We are
artists and what does it mean for all of our work to end up on teahows
and fabric and tables and no attribution or no recognition of where this
has come from and you know that that’s ah that was a complex. Question
in many ways partly because it’s about the construction of indigenous
people to start with within a social framework like settler colonial
framework like in this like Australia where indigenous people only
became citizens ah in the late 1960 s 67 um, but it’s all it was also
responding to a certain kind of economic market that was emerging around
aboriginal art as well. So there were kind of different forces that were
both political as well as ah cultural that were pushing. Law to actually
work to accommodate and include indigenous artists in the copyright
framework.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
So as I’m hearing you say this 1 thing it makes me think about is if
we’re if there’s an emphasis on the individuality of an of an artist or
an artistic ideal and this is something that you know from my background
making art I’m thinking of of this as like you know this something I run
up against too which is this idea that art comes from a singular person.
Um, so I guess my question is what have you found in terms of of kind of
either legal support or or rejection or or lack of support for
collective cultural ownership and knowledge.</p>
<p>Jane<br />
I Found that the law doesn’t do a very good job in protecting Collective
Knowledge. It can accommodate the individual so it works really well for
a singular aboriginal artist. For instance. But it doesn’t work so well
if that singular aboriginal artist is drawing upon collective knowledge
or is also part of a collective writers is kind of creating works that
draw on long-standing Ancestral traditions. Ah, it can’t accommodate
that complexity and I think that that starts to tell us a lot about the
cultural specificity of the law itself. It also tells us how difficult
it is for different kinds of worldviews to be incorporated into. Ah, the
categorical Frameworks of Western or Euro Intellectual property law.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
are there examples of this that you could describe examples of where
there’s been. Ah, need to support kind of collective ownership. Um and
ways that you’ve had to kind of be creative to help figure out some kind
of framework to support that.</p>
<p>Jane<br />
Yeah I mean I I would preface this and probably come back to it that one
of the big challenges in the area that I work in is the language of
ownership to start with and the Framework of property itself conditions.
What’s possible to think about and what’s possible to talk about So I’m
just going to bracket that and come back to it? Um, but there were a
number of case In Australia that kind of emerged you know from this
moment in the 1970 s into the kind of 80 s and 90 s where aboriginal
artists brought cases around the appropriation of their art onto carpets
in particular. Um. And their argument had to be framed within yeah, had
to be framed as one that the law could recognize right? So there’s kind
of singular aboriginal artists and but what they were portraying were.
Totemic clan designs designs that had been passed down through
generations of families that they were responsible for conveying. They
weren’t owners in that property way but they had. Very clearly
delineated responsibilities to convey the the the work in a particular
way and they felt that when it was ah you know put on a carpet for
instance. That there was a whole lot of ah, kind of cultural harm that
happened in that appropriation and and I think it’s the the cases are
very interesting in the sense that of course we’re talking about a work.
And the appropriation of a work but and that was because that’s what the
law needed in order to recognize the validity of the claim. But what the
aboriginal artists were talking about which the law couldn’t necessarily
respond to was it wasn’t just a work. Like the content of that work
really mattered. Ah it was a ah ah ah, narrative of significance to
those communities that told people where they came from and ah, what
their. Responsibilities were to particular animals and particular places
and there’s a whole deep dimension to what was being conveyed in that
work that then made um that sense that. The disrespect or the cultural
harm in appropriating it. It wasn’t just a pretty snake that was being
drawn. You know it was ah it was an animal of significance to that
community and to take that design and the the. Copy the form of that
snake in a particular way did significant harm to how the representation
of that story could be conveyed into the Future. So These are elements
that obviously couldn’t couldn’t be recognised necessarily and. I Think
what was also interesting and in these cases is that ah the community
members the artists who had brought the claim they acted as a collective
together in relationship to these cases. They took the um. The damages
collectively and divided them. They really came together in order to
kind of make the same claim. Ah, and. That was also you know not only
from what was at Stake and and why there was this particular kind of
harm but also in seeking the remedy they acted as a collective as
well.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
Have you found examples of this here in the United States as well I know
you work for example, as a professor at and Nyu I’m curious to hear if
there’s similarities in these kinds of circumstances here in the us or
is it a pretty different ecosystem.</p>
<p>Jane<br />
There’s definitely similarities across these spaces. Not only in how the
law responds and ah but also in the ways in which indigenous people and
indigenous communities find themselves subject. To that body of law. Um
the work that I do in the United States is a little bit more focused on
ah where indigenous people have lost their rights to control cultural
knowledge either in relationship. And and when I’m talking about
cultural knowledge I’m talking about sound recordings or films or
photographs or languages that are owned and controlled by non-indigenous
people and that particular problem which is enormous and. Populates our
archives, libraries and museums in multiple ways because that’s where
all that material now is um, comes about because of a certain ah
rationale in studying. Indigenous people and it’s a product of a
particular kind of extractive logic of research where people come in
document record study and take all of that material out again leaving
indigenous communities with very little including control. Over those
representations.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
Is this in some of this phenomenon What led you to starting local
context?</p>
<p>Jane<br />
Yeah, it’s exactly why I started local context. I guess for at least 10
years I had been working both in Australia and in the United States on
the problems of who owns indigenous cultural material within archives,
libraries and museums and what does it mean to try and repatriate or
reach that material if the legal ownership is held by a non-indigenous
person and I had worked with communities around building different kinds
of intellectual property strategies to respond to these kinds of
problems but I got to a point where I mean you can’t retroactively go
back and fix some of those problems right? That control was really taken
away from communities for a really long period of time right? The length
of copyright is quite extraordinary and so it became important to try
and think through what our other kinds of mechanisms that could be
developed that can support indigenous interests in regaining control and
being able to make decisions about how this material gets utilized into
the future and so I originally started thinking, okay, well maybe
licenses could do this job. You know, maybe there’s a ah license that
creative Commons haven’t yet developed that could specifically address
indigenous interests in this area. That seemed like a good idea
initially until the kind of the the light went on again which was but
actually indigenous people don’t own this material to start with and
they need to be copyright holders to have a license. So it was a bit
like oh back to the drawing board and so Local Contexts really began as
an initiative to think through how could you develop something that
actually brings indigenous cultural authority back into certain kinds of
authoritative spaces like archives, libraries and museums. But more than
that how can you push against a property model? How could you bring or
how could you create something that asks for the recognition of cultural
protocols?</p>
<p>Jane<br />
And what that was speaking to probably goes back to what I mentioned at
the very beginning around aboriginal art that what’s in a photograph or
what’s in a sound recording is really what matters. it’s not that it’s a
sound recording it’s not that it’s a photograph it’s the content has has
the most important or conveys the most important information and that’s
what’s so valuable to indigenous people and that has always been
governed by cultural protocols that exist within. Every indigenous
community. They just haven’t been recognized as law I haven’t been
incorporated into euro -american law and so it was an ah, interesting
and kind of a provocative proposition to say well. How could you do that
and if the law is failing indigenous people. Why is that and I think the
answer to that is multiple. There’s multiple answers to that. But 1 of
them is that the law was never designed to support indigenous interests
in the first place. So it can on the sides do that work but centrally it
doesn’t and won’t and can’t so what else are you left with um to
actually do that work that indigenous communities. Demand to be done in
a respectful, thoughtful responsible relational way and that’s where
local context came from.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
And with that background. Can you say a little about how local context
works on your website. It says that local context provides a new set of
procedural Workflows. What does that mean. What what does local context
do in that in in that context.</p>
<p>Jane<br />
So Local contexts provides a set of digital tags that allows communities
to put either information around attribution or. Correct provenance or
protocols around knowledge sharing ah back into Contexts where their
cultural material currently sits and to do That. Takes a little bit of
work. Um, so and what’s important about the digital tagging or labeling
system is that you know the intervention is really at the level Of.
Digital infrastructures in in many ways. Um, that’s partly because so
much of this material has been digitized and circulates without anybody
having any sense that there are indigenous protocols around how this
should be utilized when it should be heard. How it should be listened to
and an invitation to be actually engaging with the communities whose
material it continues to be and so in many ways the digital tag system
is ah intervention. At a metadata level but it’s also asking people who
encounter indigenous cultural material to think a little bit about how
it came to be where they’re viewing it and that these communities. Still
exist and still have rights in relationship to how this material should
be used even if they’re not recognized as copyright rights so
communities customize their labels and. Then they work with institutions
to implement them into institutional Contexts where that material
currently sits or they customize their labels and use them on their own
websites Just as. Particular kinds of markers to say and this is the
right way of engaging with this material. We don’t want you to use this
in a commercial Context. We do want you to engage with us. We are really
happy for you to kind of use this material for educational.</p>
<p>Jane<br />
Reasons Um, and I think that that’s what the the labels do is that they
provide an avenue for indigenous communities to articulate. What their
expectations are in relationship to using their cultural material.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
That sounds lovely. Can you give examples of how this it does it does
and I’m like curious can you give examples of how this has worked in the
past.</p>
<p>Jane<br />
Yeah, so I I mean I can give you the example that is probably the most
cited example, but there are many others and this is the one that
involves the Passamoquady sound recordings these pass mcquord sound
recordings that were made in 1890. They’re the first sound recordings
made on native lands in this country and they they know the story of the
sound recording themselves is interesting in the sense that they get
lost. And then they’re refound and they end up at the library of
congress but they never were made for pasamacquddy people they were kind
of a sound experiment that ah the researcher Jesse Walter Fukes was
doing as he became the head of the expedition into hopi and zuni lands
later in 1890 so it’s kind of testing his equipment. Um and they the
soundcon has never really made it back to the pasamaququaddy no one
thought? ah. Return them or to share them and it wasn’t until really the
1980 s that I happened but the technology was really poor and so when
those recordings did get returned. They were so scratchy people couldn’t
really understand what was on them so it took you know another. Shift in
technology to be able to hear those recordings in a different kind of
way and in that process passmaquody decided that they wanted to use ah
the traditional knowledge labels as part of their work. Both Determining
the content like what were these songs about ah and sharing that
traditional knowledge or that information back to the library of
congress in a way that they felt comfortable doing partly because they
were using these labels to demarcate what exactly were. Passamquaddies
continued interests in these recordings. So so you go now.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
So I Sorry I have a I have a pretty good knowledge of working with
creative Commons material since I’ve been I’ve I’ve with my own art and
music I’ve I’ve used a creative Commons label. To identify you know work
of mine that I want to be able to to share and have other people be able
to kind of reuse in various ways and provide a context for how that can
be reused. It can’t be used commercially but it can be Used. You know,
non-commercially and has to be shared. For example, the the labels
that.</p>
<p>Jane<br />
Yeah, so. Um, yes, um.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
Local context has has kind of come up with does it work in a similar
process I’m curious about some of the specifics of these tools.</p>
<p>Jane<br />
Yeah, it. It really does work in a similar process in a similar way and
you know we were in conversation with creative commons very early in the
development of the of the labels. The primary difference between the
labels and. Creative commons is that the label use the labels when you
don’t have any legal right. the labels come in to operation because
those rights don’t exist. For those communities in order to utilize a
creative commons license, for instance like you were just saying that
you could do it because and you can use a creative commons license
because you hold the copyright in the work itself in the first instance,
if that copyright is held by a third party. You can’t use the creative
commons license and so this is where the majority of indigenous people
find themselves in relationship to their cultural material is that
they’re not the owners of it. So. What the difference with our tool is
to creative commons is that it provides a mechanism that allows
communities to convey their cultural interests in a way. Even if they’re
not the legal. Rights holders and I guess I would say the other thing
that the labels do which is different to creative commons is that we’re
operating within a different. Cultural paradigm of responsibility around
the content itself which is why we have multiple kinds of labels right?
So we have ah a seasonal label which speaks to. Concerns that
communities have around when particular stories are told at particular
times of the year and that there are restrictions around when certain
kinds of songs are sung or when. Certain kinds of stories are told
because of the environment that’s a nuance that creative commons doesn’t
get to because it’s focusing on use of a work. Not the cultural
frameworks in which that work. Has meaning um across kind of a spectrum
that connects knowledge to land and to place.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
One similarity that I’m thinking about and correct me if I’m wrong is
that the use of labels and even licenses is often in addition to kind of
a legal structure is often. Kind of a signpost or indicator of
something. It’s a way of of kind of creating a symbolic meaningful
statement about one’s work or a group’s work or a community’s work how
much of.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
Labeling system. Do you think how much you know, do you think of this
labeling as doing something like that providing a symbolic statement um
versus a a particular legal framework. For example.</p>
<p>Jane<br />
Yeah I Think that’s a great question. It is very symbolic in in one Way.
Ah because it’s pointing to something that might not otherwise be Seen.
It’s pointing to the existence of cultural Authority that might not
otherwise have been thought about for a variety of reasons and so in
that sense that kind of icon. But the labels ah deploy is ah is a one
that’s trying to get a visual recognition um into a different like in a
different kind of way. But. And think what the labels do by by then kind
of making that step so in the absence of there being anything that could
support or make visible already existing indigenous cultural authority
around this material adding a label is a step. Towards a next place
which is indigenous communities being at the table making decisions over
how that material gets used in the future I feel like it’s important
that labeling in this instance or a particular kind of the traditional
knowledge labels or the biocultural labels Is not an end in itself. It’s
part of a process that is elevating and making visible indigenous rights
in a way that means that indigenous people are part of future
decision-making about their cultural forms of representation.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
Thanks so much, and thanks for taking so much time speaking with me.</p>
<p>Jane</p>
<p>Thanks Lee, bye.</p>
<p>After speaking with Jane, I was eager to talk with a community using
local contexts to contextualize their work and to find out a bit more on
how it’s going. I spoke with Courtney Papunee from the Te Whakatōhea
iwi. An iwi is a people or nation in maori society.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
Can you say your full name.</p>
<p>Courtney<br />
my name is Courtney Papunee.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
Can you so identify your your tribe, or your iwi, if I’m saying that
correctly?</p>
<p>Courtney<br />
Yep, I have a few but the one that I do work for at the moment is Te
Whakatōhea here which is located in Ōpōtiki area, which is the Bay of
Plenty of New Zealand Aotearoa so we’re on the East Coast of the North
Island.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
Correct me if I’m wrong here, my understanding is that things like
photographs, music recordings, film dictionaries and other materials
relating to the iwi and and actually indigenous communities in general
were often done or taken without permission, and by people outside the
community. I’m curious how this has affected how your community could
determine how items could be shared or used or presented?</p>
<p>Courtney I’m not sure so much about recordings but definitely our
histories. And our stories were usually told by what we would say are
tauiwi, people that aren’t Maori. So they recorded our histories in the
past and often it was with a lens that was very foreign to how we would
view the world. So growing up learning about our own history we would
learn it from a Pākehā or colonized view of things, but oftentimes when
they did record our stories it would actually be our tipuna or our
ancestors that would contribute some of that kōrero. So the the problem
lies um where our iwi or our community don’t know that that information
is out there. And you know with intellectual property rights and stuff
like that like copyright and all of that stuff it often has caused us to
become disconnected with our knowledge but also to have no say over
where it’s stored. And so at the moment I’m working on a project to help
at least put our Whakatōhea voice on our taonga, our stuff, our
knowledge that’s out there at the moment. So a lot of our knowledge and
taonga which is I guess gifts or artifacts, I think might be a good
english word, sit outside of our iwi like our museums or libraries or
archives. So generally they were taken by people as collectors items or
were recorded by people that weren’t from our community. Does that make
sense?</p>
<p>Lee<br />
It does and I can imagine that this phenomenon has really accelerated as
the internet has become so ubiquitous today and data or artifacts or
digitized gifts I think was the other word you used, as these can be
digitized in various ways or not, there’s even less an ability.</p>
<p>Courtney<br />
I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of haka or Maori performing arts where
we sing and do poi and that’s a big deal not just in our iwi but as a
whole community of Maori so Kapa haka and stuff like that is very
important. So this stuff is still happening because the companies in
other countries are taking our images and putting it on their… well one
of our friends, her face was put on a shower curtain and she’s quite
well known. She wouldn’t like me to say famous but she’s very well known
in the Maori community and her face was put on a shower curtain in China
without her permission. So yes stuff is out in the internet and it’s
being used without our permission and I think using the traditional
knowledge labels as a way that we can help reign in that behavior and
and ask people to be more ethical about how they use our precious
taonga, our people’s faces, our stuff, our knowledge, stuff like
that.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
I’m really curious if you could explain what the traditional knowledge
labels are, what they mean to you, and how you’ve customized them?</p>
<p>Courtney<br />
I Think what they mean to me personally is an opportunity for us to to
guide researchers and institutions on how we wish our knowledge to be
accessed and used. There’s nothing out there at the moment that guides
anyone on anything so if the information is available they can use it
however they like without even verifying the information. Whereas if
there’s a label therefore people who are interested in the ethical use
of the information they come across it there’s a label there that we
have customized to show them how we wish to use that information and I
think that’s really important because there’s nothing out there like
that I’ve seen at the moment that indigenous peoples can use. I mean
there’s data sovereignty and some other really cool crop up that’s
happening out there but this is the one that we’ve been given to trial
and from what I can see so far especially working with, learning from
indigenous communities in the states that are already using them it’s
actually quite an easy to use tool.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
Do you have one at hand that you’d be able to share?</p>
<p>Courtney<br />
The one we always talk about is attribution. So the attribution label
can be used to correct historical mistakes. So there could have been an
issue for instance, who wrote a song. So after I finish here with you
we’re going to start assessing labels for our waiata app. Now waiata in
english is song so our iwi’s got a song app. So songs that are from our
iwi have been put into this app for our iwi to access and learn. So
there’s a song in there that has been a bit contentious in terms of who
wrote it, who actually was involved in the writing of it. So if I was to
talk about a label we would put probably attribution on there because
it’s correcting a historical misunderstanding of who wrote the song. So
there’s lots of historical misunderstandings when it comes to our
mātauranga, our knowledge. And so if I was to talk about a label it
would be attribution because we could use that to correct historical
mistakes and then you could use verify, the verify label, to show
external users that the information that they have come across has been
verified by the people that the information is about.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
One of the things I’m also thinking about is how often copyright rewards
individual or corporate ownership and I’m curious how you’ve either run
up against this or needed to respond to this in terms of collective
ownership or community ownership or even different consideration of what
ownership even means in different contexts.</p>
<p>Courtney<br />
Yeah, actually we have come up against it because we’ve recently been
given links to audio recordings of people from our iwi on radio stations
and whatnot. So we’re allowed to put labels on them. But we have to be
aware that they also have copyright rights somewhere else. So I’m not
really sure how we’re going to navigate that space. But how we have done
it for our iwi is taught them. So at our one that I told you about
earlier we taught our attendees that were there about copyright. And how
in the past it’s been used to disenfranchise us or disconnect us with
our taonga. And they had no idea. Like why would you unless you needed
to know? Well we know generally about copyright but we have never really
talked about how it’s been used to disinherit indigenous people from
their taonga. We have come up against it but we’re still navigating that
space with the institution that have gifted it to us. Oh well, given us
the metadata for those files. We’re still trying to figure it out over
here. Have you had any conversations with other indigenous communities
that have come up against that?</p>
<p>Lee<br />
I haven’t yet. I’m really interested but I haven’t yet.</p>
<p>Courtney Me too because quite often in this project we’ll look to the
ones that have done it first, like the Penobscot Passamaquoddy people.
They had the wax cylinders I think and I think that was repatriated back
to them but I’m not sure about the copyright stuff here. But I’d be
really interested to know if you do find out.</p>
<p>Courtney<br />
The way indigenous people look at things and the way tauiwi look at
things are so different. We don’t own anything really. We’re whakataki
(?) even of knowledge that’s in our songs. One person might write the
song. But generally the collective knowledge is what helped inform that
song. You know what I mean? So we don’t really own. Yeah, indigenous
people are guardians of their stuff. So copyright to me is just… It just
doesn’t work. Not for us, and not for the way we view the world. It
cracks me up. But we only just really are reawakening to all of this.
There’s like many people before me that have done this type of work. But
myself personally I’m just doing this project. It’s where I can open my
eyes and it’s waking me up to stuff I had no idea about.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
It sounds like both really important and really interesting work.</p>
<p>Courtney Yeah, definitely. I’ve met some really amazing people that
have been doing this stuff for decades. I sat in a training last year
with a first nation woman over in the states and she was just in tears.
She’d been doing it for four decades and she could finally see light in
terms of putting their voice on their knowledge and their artifacts and
gifts and stuff that they’re gonna make in the future as well. It’s
pretty cool, pretty cool.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
That’s cool.</p>
<p>Courtney<br />
Yeah, yeah, very lucky.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
Well thank you so much I really appreciate you speaking with me today.
It’s really interesting. I really enjoyed speaking with you. I learned a
lot.</p>
<p>Courtney<br />
You are welcome. Glad to be of some help and I look forward to seeing
what other cool stuff you find along your path.</p>

I started doing research into today’s episode when I was looking into
ideas of decolonization and cultural appropriation and how that was
dealt with in copyright. And I was quickly connected to Jane Anderson, a
lawyer and professor of NYU Law and a co-founder of Local Contexts,
which was created to deal with the needs of indigineous communities and
local organizations who wanted a practical method to deal with the
intellectual property materials of their cultural heritage materials.
Especially when it comes to issues of ownership. And what I find
interesting about local contexs, similarly to cultural commons, it’s a
kind of hack on copyright. In this case with local contexts, they’re
dealing with imposed western values of ownership, which you can hear
Courtney acknowledge as not really working with their iwi and having
their cultural works, artifacts and music - these are just a few
examples, taken, quote unquote owned by museums or other entities that
may have plundered these cultural heritage, dozens or hundreds of years
ago, or are presenting community songs and oral works from these
communities. According to the copyright system, these works generally
aren’t owned from the communities in which they’re from because they
were taken a long time ago for example, or the community didn’t quote
unquote copyright them originally because they weren’t property, they
were an inherent part of that community and its heritage. Local Contexts
is one attempt at addressing this, and it’s being used and adapted by
indigineous and local communities worldwide, so I was really interested
in hearing how it’s being used and how it’s going as it’s developing. In
Courtney’s iwi they’re using local contexts because of these issues, a
need to state and share how the community want the work of their
community and cultural heritage to be shared, accessed and presented,
and Local contexts is a framework for asserting indigineous organizing,
governance and decision-making. This way of working is meant to empower
the community using it, and to guide future collections and public
presentations and scholarship of cultural heritage and indigineous data.
And it’s a very practical system addressing inequity and using legal
tools in the here and now, but clearly also serving as a needed model to
guide how law should be reformed in this area. For that, I was really
excited to learn and hear how it’s being used and adapted. And if you
have thoughts or suggestions on other communities that are working in
different ways to adapt the law and how it’s practiced, to adapt to a
community’s cultural assets, culture, art and other creations, I’d love
to hear about it.</p>
