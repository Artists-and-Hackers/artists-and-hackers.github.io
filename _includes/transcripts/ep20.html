<h3 id="lawyers-and-hackers">Lawyers and Hackers</h3>
<p>You’re listening to Artists and Hackers, <strong>A Podcast On Art,
Code and Community.</strong> We talk to programmers, artists, poets,
musicians, botmakers, educators, students and designers in an effort to
critically look at both online art-making and the history of technology
and the internet. We’re interested in where we’ve been and speculative
ideas on the future.</p>
<p>In this season of the podcast we’re working with the Engelberg Center
on Innovation Law and Policy at NYU Law. In addition to our usual crop
of artists and programmers we’re adding in legal scholars to help us
unpack some of the thorny issues for those working in art and code as
they unleash their work into the world. We’ll also talk to communities
aiming to alter the context of how their cultural work is presented. Who
can remix? What does the law have to do with cultural appropriation? How
are artists hacking copyright? Those are a few of the area we’ll get
into.</p>
<p>I think it’s fair to say that most artists and probably many
programmers would be happy to stay as far away from lawyers as possible.
But the Engelberg Center is is unique. They have people researching and
making recommendations about the right to repair movement, working with
indigineous and cultural communities to protect their cultural heritage,
and folks that look at the limits of current law where it regards
artificial intelligence and surveillance.</p>
<p>So To kick off the season I thought it would be helpful to talk to
Michael Weinberg, the Director of the Engelberg Center, to get an
overview of the center and some of the areas that I thought our
listeners would be interested in.</p>
<p>I asked about some of the areas we’ll be covering in future episodes
such as open source, creative commons, public domain, fair use and some
of the ways that artists have attempted to hack our laws around
copyright.</p>
<p>In past episodes we talked about open source, a term originally used
for software source code that is shared by its creator and made
available for modification and sharing new versions.</p>
<p>Open source software is now ubiquitous, and powers much of the
technology we use today. And Artists and creators became interested in
open source as a way to share their own work, to allow others to remix
their artwork, modify and share it further.</p>
<p>And now the borders between artists, programmers and other categories
are falling away - artists have become toolbuilders as well. I spoke
with Michael about the evolution of open source and other areas where
creators embrace or push against the rules of copyright.</p>
<p>Lee Tusman<br />
It’s such a huge part of the culture of programming and certainly in art
and code, and so I wanted to start out by asking you what open source
means to you?</p>
<p>Michael Weinberg<br />
To be a little bit lawyerly about it I think it really depends on the
context because there’s certainly a world where open source means openly
licensed and creative expression or works that includes software and a
huge range of other things that are. Licensed in a way that not only
allow other people to build on them and to use them but encourage them
to do so but I actually think that’s a really narrow view of open source
I Think more broadly open source is really about creating as part of an
ongoing community. Dialogue and knowing that you are drawing from that
community and the work of so many others before you and that you are
intentionally contributing back to that community in the hopes that
other people in the community will build on what you have been
doing.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
In my experience. There’s many folks coming from an like an artistic or
cultural background. Maybe they start learning to code or or they’re
quite advanced in it. They’re making software or hardware that’s used by
a wider community and in open source. The. Culture and very much what
you were speaking about is on sharing and making resources available to
others but there can also be a tension point in protecting culture or
preventing someone with different values from using code or cultural
commons for example and I’m curious if this is something you come across
in your work and how you’re considering this recently.</p>
<p>Michael The tension is when you put something out into the world and
invite other people to use it, you invite other people to use it who may
not be exactly like you . who may not share your values and so one of
the challenges with open source is coming to terms with that and
deciding what you want to do about that and I think in the earliest days
of, what you might think of as the formal open source movement, there
was a real push towards saying ‘look when you put something out in the
world in an open Way, you’re inviting people to use it and you need to
be willing to accept the fact that there are going to be people who use
it in ways that you don’t love and hope that on balance. More people use
it in a way that you like than in a way you don’t like.’ But I think
that there has been a new wave of interest in revisiting that assumption
and that structure and trying to understand if there are ways to work
Within. An open framework at least an open framework broadly defined in
a way that does bring some of the values questions into the discussion
and maybe even put them close to the front of the discussion.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
One of the things that interests me is as artists and cultural
practitioners and theorists and others get involved in maybe this
broader community and movement and are creating these alternative things
like for example, the anti-capitalist software license. I’m curious how
that kind of goes back and gets reflected in law.</p>
<p>Michael I think that this is one of the challenges when you think
about open source and licensing and ethics because if you think about
open source licenses as a legal document then you very quickly get into
this conversation of definitions. And how you define what is ethically
okay, what is ethically not okay. Obviously that is a debate that
philosophers and theologians and all sorts of people have had for
millennia and so it can be hard to reduce those ideas to an easy to
understand legal license.</p>
<p>The important thing to recognize is the legal lens isn’t the only
lens you can use to think about these things because. Especially in open
source the licenses act on 1 level kind of a legal level. But also they
act as a signal. They act on a cultural level to say hey I’m putting
this out into the world and here are my expectations. Those expectations
may or may not be legally enforceable in the way that I believe them to
be. But at a minimum I’m going to use this license structure to
communicate something to you the user about what I the creator would
like to have this this work be used, and how it would be used and so
yeah I think it really depends on how closely you want to think about
these licenses as legal licenses and how much do you want to think about
them as cultural statements and they can create all sorts of problems
when people are actually thinking about one way and and but want to
think about it in the other way but I think the the kind of honest way
to think about it is as these licenses.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
So Michael mentioned the Anti-capitalist Software License. So I thought
now would be a good time to speak to artists and programmers, the very
people that created that license. We interviewed Ramsey Nasser in our
first episode of the podcast. Together with Everest Pipkin, they created
the Anti-Capitalist Software License. Ramsey is a computer scientist, a
game designer, and an educator. I caught up with Ramsey online to ask
him a few questions.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
I just wanted to start to ask you? What is a software license for?</p>
<p>Ramsey Nasser<br />
A software license, and I’m not a lawyer, I happen to be the son of a
lawyer and an an intellectual property lawyer of all things. So I’m
gonna, I think, bring shame upon my family by getting some of this stuff
wrong. But a software license is an agreement basically that is attached
to software that outlines how it can be used and who can use it and
under what conditions.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
So we’ve had software license for a really long time and in particular,
we’ve had free and open source software licenses. What’s wrong with
those that you felt the need to create the anti-capitalist software
license with Everest?</p>
<p>Ramsey<br />
Yeah, so um, a couple of things and I’ve been in the open source world
for a very long time. I’m actually speaking to you off of a linux
desktop that I lovingly maintain. So it’s a world that’s been a big part
of my life and I’m very fond of it. I think it’s done very good things.
What brought me into thinking about the sort of limitations of the
worldview of open source licenses is the sort of the observation that
you know we had open source for like you said for many many years and
yet we’ve had billionaire tech companies rise up not sort of and not
even in spite of open source software, I think building on open source
software. That’s the sort of peculiar observation right? This movement
that to me was pitched as you know liberatory and emancipatory and
designed to like put everyone on the same level is producing pharaohs
effectively. So that’s the sort of beginnings of my questionings I think
of like open source as it’s currently defined and the licenses as they
are currently available and that sort of inquiry led me towards the
ACSL.</p>
<p>The free software movement enables us to build a world where
Microsoft. Share is more of its source code which we’re seeing it do
right and Amazon shares more of its source code. Ah it can’t move us
towards a world where things like Microsoft can’t exist ah people like
Jeff Bezos can’t exist that that’s a non goal of the free software
movement and the open source movement. Um. Which increasingly I think as
we face you know, income and like wealth disparity and climate collapse
I I it it is my political belief that we need to be actively dismantling
capitalism and the open source movement just does not do that I think a
lot of people think it does I did for a very long time. It. It tends to
get pitched that way but at the. The bottom line is it’s ah it’s a
worldview of people should share source code and that’s about it. So in
terms of intentionality the ACSL is sort of born out of a desire to
attach a license to software that we put onto the world that expresses a
different worldview. with more what I think more complete politics
around capitalism.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
Okay I think there’d be a lot of artists and other kinds of cultural
workers out there that are really turned off by some of our legal kind
of quibbling or discussion here and are probably you know maybe I wrong
but are probably thinking like hey you know like artist is Punk Rock.
It’s D I y I want to do my thing and. And maybe not worry about all this
um and and then some people even choose something like you know I don’t
want to have ah a legal um system in place. Um, you know I don’t want to
have to think about this. Can you say a little about what happens by
default I make some artwork I make a piece of music I put it out there
in the world. Um, what if if if I make no choice if I don’t actually say
hey this is you know this is copyrighted or this is public domain or
this is creative Commons. What actually happens and and governs how my
work can be used.</p>
<p>Michael<br />
Yeah, this is a great question sort of you know if you if you want to
step away and say I don’t want to deal with any of this I just want to
put it out in the world what happens? And so assuming the thing that
we’re talking about is in the category of works that are protectable by
copyright and that’s basically anything that’s going to be anything that
you think that an artist. would make. So those works are you can think
of them as being born closed by default the moment they spring into the
world. They are automatically protected by copyright now. There are
reasons that you might want to register that copyright. And there are
reasons that you might want to put a little copyright notice on them.
But none of those are requirements to be protected by copyright if you
make it if it exists in the world. It’s automatically protected by
copyright for your entire life plus 70 years after your death and anyone
who wants to make copies of that work and there are all sorts of ways to
think of copies. They need your permission to make those copies or a
reason not to need your permission like fair use and so if you do
nothing then your work is fully protected by copyright. And anyone who
wants to make use of it is probably going to have to start by asking you
for permission and that may be totally fine with you right? If that’s
what you want to do? That’s what you want to do. But if you want other
people to engage with your work and maybe build on it or remix it or
kind of you know, incorporate into what they are doing. If you do
nothing else but put it out into the world. You are creating a kind of
you’re putting a little little little time bomb in there.** Some point
in the future someone else might might come in or or have the rights to
your work or or maybe 40 years after you’re dead somebody comes along
and says oh there’s still 30 years of copyright protection on this I
want to sue you for it or and this is kind of more likely someone’s
going to want to use your work. And either not be able to get in touch
with you or be afraid to reach out or whatever it is and say well if I
don’t have permission to use it I’m just going to move on to something
else I’m not going to use this work because I need I know I need
permission to do it either through a copyright license like a creative
commons license or something else. And so the default state will will be
that your work is used less than it would be if you took that a tiny
extra little step and put a license that said not only am I inviting you
to use this work under whatever terms I’m putting it out under. But also
I’m giving you legal protection. If you do do that and making you a
legal promise that I’m not going to kind of appear ten years later and
sue you.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
Now, let’s say I’m totally on board with this and I’m an artist and I
actually I don’t want any restrictions for people that might want to use
my work. Maybe I believe that all cultural you know produced work and
artwork and you know works in general should be freely reusable
remixable, interpretable, you know any way you could use something or
consume something and engage with it and and try to change something all
of that should be allowed. So um, My understanding is you’d want to say
okay this is in the public domain anyone may use this can you say a
little bit more about what the public domain is and how one might
dedicate your your work to the public domain and and if there are any
restrictions on that?</p>
<p>Michael Yeah, so exactly. So the public domain is the cultural space
where no one has ownership over it so those are things that maybe
someone has actively dedicated to the public domain or where the
copyright protection has expired. So. You know a greek statue from two
thousand years ago there’s no copyright protection on it. Anyone can use
it to do whatever they want from a copyright standpoint at least and
it’s it’s totally free for the pickings and you can you know same with
ah a Shakespeare play same with ah anything in the Us. Was basically
produced before 1925? Um, if you create something today then as we as we
talked about if you create something today then it is born closed. It is
not in the public domain by default and it won’t be in the public domain
until 70 years after your death. And so you have take an active step to
dedicate your work to the public domain fortunately creative commons has
come up with this great tool. It’s like 1 of their licenses. Although
technically, it’s a public domain dedication. It’s called cc zero and so
you can attach the cc zero. Ah. Dedication to your work the same way you
would use use it as a license and you are saying I know that when I
created this work. It was born closed and it’s going to be protected for
my life plus 70 years but I hereby dedicate this to the public domain
and waive all of my rights and ability to control. From this day
forward.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
All right? So one of the strange things that’s happening is artists and
software writers, programmers and other people are making tools that are
used to make artwork. Let’s say I make a tool, maybe I make some new
kind of digital painting software, or I write a machine learning library
that others can use to generate poetry or plays or dances. What are some
of the structures around what I can kind of specify in terms of who uses
that software to make artwork. If I make this tool to make digital
paintings do I own the digital paintings that other artists that use my
software make? Is there any restrictions on the work that they make or
that I can even say about what they make with my software?</p>
<p>Michael<br />
First off owning the copyright in a tool does not necessarily or
automatically give you ownership in the things that are made with the
tool. If I type something in Microsoft Word, if I write a book in
Microsoft word, Microsoft does not own my book. Now we’re using podcast
recording software to record this interview. The company that makes the
software to record the interview does not own a copyright in the
podcast. And so…or the or the company that makes the editing software
you use to edit everything together and and remove all of my ums and
stammers does not own the output, the thing that you create with the
tools. Now that distinction can feel like it breaks down a little bit
when you have some of these, especially some of these machine
learning-based tools that feel like instead of a person using the tool
to create a work it’s kind of the tool doing all of the work itself and
there isn’t really a person involved. There’s a little bit of debate, I
mean there’s a little bit of debate in legal world as to what should
happen in that case. I think the best answer and the answer that has
been the case up until now and probably will continue to be the case for
the foreseeable future is that you need a person to have a copyright.
And so if it is actually true that just a robot made whatever the work
is, that’s great. The work exists in the world but the robot doesn’t own
the copyright. And this is actually very similar to a case that was high
profile or at least high profile in copyright legal nerd world a couple
years ago where it was called the “monkey selfie case” and it was a
situation where there was a picture that went viral on the internet and
the story of the picture was that some monkeys had stolen a
photographer’s camera out of his bag and taken a bunch of pictures of
themselves because they were… or they’d come up to a camera because they
were seeing their reflection in the lens and they were kind of
fascinated with it and so they were they were taking pictures of
themselves basically. And so it went viral. The pictures were very cute.
And then the photographer tried to assert copyright over the pictures.
And the court, and ultimately this is the copyright office, has put this
in their big book of copyright rules, it’s called the Compendium of
Copyright. The monkeys took the picture, but monkeys aren’t people and
so monkeys can’t have copyright. And so it feels like monkeys taking
selfies is very different from an elaborate AI machine learning
algorithm generating art. But I think the principle was the same which
is you need a person involved in order to be able to have a copyright in
the first place. And there are lots of good reasons for that. One of
which is if you want to use that photograph or the image or whatever it
was generated, you need a license from somebody. And you know a monkey
can’t give you a license, can’t enter into a licensing agreement. A
robot can’t enter into a licensing agreement. So there just needs to be
a person for the system to work at all.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
What about the person that wrote the robot software or um, you know I I
guess I’m I’m trying to push at the limits here I’m trying to figure out
where does that end and the robot begins.</p>
<p>Michael<br />
Yeah, right? I mean this is a good question right? And I think it it
becomes a little bit of a fact specific question. If the person who
wrote the software is really the driving Creative force behind the
output Then you can probably argue that the person who wrote the
software is sort of working all the way through the process if you can
really draw a straight line between the person who wrote the software
and the output then maybe there’s an argument for that. But in that
case, the the software isn’t really a tool in the sense that you know a
word processor is a tool right? It’s It’s more kind of part of the work
that they are doing and it’s a tool being manipulated by the creator as
as she’s creating it Potentially if the creator if someone creates a
tool and then someone else comes along and uses the tool to achieve some
sort of creative output. In that case, it probably is the case that that
person who’s using the tool is providing the creative Spark and so maybe
they’re the person who should own the copyright and you can you can make
up hypotheticals that really kind of finally, that draw really fine
distinctions here and those hypotheticals will probably pop up in
reality over the next couple years. But I think you still get to a
situation where the fundamental question is who is the person who is
ultimately responsible for the creative spark behind this specific work.
When you’re making these decisions, try and empower the good users and
not spend a lot of time trying to limit the bad faith users. Think about
who you want to be using this and how you want them to be using it and
put in place the licensing structure that allows them to do it.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
Keeping Michael’s words here in mind, I got in touch with some of the
team behind the ml5.js library, which describes itself as a tool to make
friendly machine learning for the web, a neighborly approach to creating
and exploring artificial intelligence in the browser. I talked online to
two of the organizers, who both got involved through their connection to
NYU’s ITP graduate program, and their connection to Daniel Shiffman, a
member of the Processing Foundation and a professor in the
university.*</p>
<p>Joey Lee<br />
My name is Joey Lee and I am currently a senior software engineer at the
New York Times</p>
<p>Ashley Jane Lewis<br />
My name is Ashley Jane Lewis. I’m a new media artist a creative
technologist and currently I’m also managing a design art and technology
incubator in Toronto.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
Can you tell me what ml5.js is?</p>
<p>Joey ml5 is a software and it is also a community of people who are
interested in machine learning on the web. Cristobal Valenzuela who was
a student at ITP back between like 2007 and 2019 I think was when he was
a student. He had this idea like what if we could create a wrapper
around the tensorflow.js API and make it super easy to load pre-trained
machine learning models and use them in the context of creative coding.
We basically went from a situation where it was really hard to do any of
this kind of computer vision stuff. And then ml5 made that really easy
to do in the browser with p5.js and so was this exciting moment where
Google Tensorflow.js came out. Organically it grew into this really cool
software project and then this really cool community. And it became this
project where we could ask and poke at these social questions,
especially given the context. The pandemic was happening, the BLM
protests were happening. It was just like a lot of things.</p>
<p>Ashley<br />
But Joey missing that Joey’s a big part of this. Which was Joey’s
influence. Because there was way before the pandemic like 2018, 2019,
before we’d even really known that this was a looming thing that would
shift the way we work, Joey was bringing forward concerns about the ways
in which we were perhaps leaving like holes available for harm to take
place. Like bringing up issues that had been submitted and comments that
he was finding online. And this was also tied to, I mean I’m not really
familiar with how ITP is at this particular moment in time, but at the
time there were you know issues around trying to have space to discuss
potential harm and machine learning and computational systems in that
educational context. These were things that I was talking about in the
classroom setting and Joey was talking about as ‘hey should we be
thinking about how we’re keeping people safe.’ Keeping an eye on how
people feel in the community. I would say that we probably would have
gotten there anyways because of the way the pandemic happened and it
became keeping people safe, a very important concern. But way before
this it was also a thing we began doing in terms of considering what our
responsibility is as people who maintain this software. That was
something that was…Joey, you should credit yourself for bringing forward
and putting some pressure into the system to try to encourage us to have
a different headspace around what we do as maintainers.</p>
<p>Joey<br />
I mean I think what we’re talking about is where we were landing
historically was this time when we went from the techno kids at the
candy store, everything is great. Everything is awesome. Peak techno
positivism, to a moment in which we started to look more critically on
what it is that we were doing. What we were making as technologists,
software developers, designers over the last ten years, we’re we’re in
this zone where books like data feminism were coming out, the Age of
Surveillance Capitalism. Black software. Algorithms Of Repression. You
look like a thing and I love you.</p>
<p>Ashley<br />
The algorithms of oppression.</p>
<p>Joey I think all of this literature was coming out. All these books,
all this kind of scholarship was basically coming out and I think it was
a signal of the times. That we’re no longer in this moment when
everything is great. As artists and designers our skill is our
imagination and a lot of that has to do with what can we imagine using
things for, and I think in this world in which we only imagine positive
uses of things, and yes you can kind of infinitely build stuff, and just
hope for the best. It became clear that it’s time to use our imagination
to also try to predict ways in which things aren’t going to be used well
and sort of bake that into what we hope our things are used for and to
enforce our vision for these things and the the way they work in the
world.</p>
<p>Ashley<br />
If your software does not have parameters around how you keep people of
color safe, it’s not for people of color if your software doesn’t have
parameters of how you keep queer people safe, especially in a machine
learning context that is so interested in identifying body types and
body structures, then your software is not for people who are queer. And
so when you start to ask these questions of who is this for? Who are we
centering? The answer as you whittle it down becomes like, oops, we
might be making software for white straight people. Whoops! And I don’t
think anybody really loves that as an idea. But because we’re not super
accustomed to asking those kinds of questions, sometimes we do those
things without a lot of intention, without a lot of conscious measuring
of what we’re actually doing, and so that question came up a lot as we
were trying to set an intention. I asked that question of the group a
lot when we were setting this intention of trying to design this new
perspective, this new outlook on how we create and maintain a community.
Because by the very nature of not doing those things, we are designing a
very very safe, very comfortable community for the majority.</p>
<p>Joey<br />
We have basically a code of conduct and a license and they are living
together and each sort of inform one another and maybe the meat of it is
that the code of conduct is really something that is meant to evolve and
change over time.</p>
<p>Ashley<br />
I think one cool thing to note is that we approached a group of people
who were doing mindful justice oriented work in other technological
spaces and we asked them to review our documents as well.</p>
<p>Joey<br />
I might add Lee that probably the way that I would frame it is that we
were a group of really caring socially-oriented people and the thing
that we were bound together was this commitment to our values, which is
that we want to center a group of people that historically is not
centered in software because we can.</p>
<p>Lee<br />
That was Joey Lee and Ashley Jane Lewis, two of the organizers behind
the ml5.js library, a software tool and community built around creating
what they call friendly machine learning for the web, aimed at artists,
creative coders and students. Joey and Ashley do things like making bug
fixes to the software, as well as serving on the teams that created a
code of conduct and their <a
href="https://github.com/ml5js/Code-of-Conduct/blob/main/LICENSE.md">ml5.js
software license</a>.</p>
<p>I was interested in talking with them as well as the creators of the
Anti-Capitalist Software License because we’re at a current moment in
time where lots of creators, programmers or otherwise, are concerned
about their place in the world - whether that’s seeing how artists
contribute to processes of gentrification, to how someone might make an
art-making tool, or a cool new online community, and find that their
software or their platform ends up hurting the kinds of people they had
been interested in empowering.</p>
<p>These are thorny issues, and open source software has been around for
a long time, several decades now, but the desire to square our ethical
concerns and how to spell out who may use our work and how it may be
used, that seems to have heated up in the past few years. As an example,
the federated social media platform called Mastodon has grown in the
past few years. It now has a few million users, we’re on there at
artistsandhackers@post.lurk.org - and it’s an incredible alternative to
things like Twitter. For example, there’s no advertisements, it’s just a
simple chronological timeline, there’s no celebrities posting, there
isn’t a deluge of instant news and angry reaction cycles. But you may
also be aware that the code is open source and has been used by
everything from Donald Trump’s own social media platform to various
alt-right social media platforms. The folks behind the Anti-Capitalist
Software License, the ml5.js team, and many other software creators are
wrestling with just these issues - how to square one’s ethics with what
we put out into the world for others to use?</p>
<p>In our upcoming episodes, we’ll be looking more into these topics.
We’ll speak to remix artists, members of Maori communities looking to
inform the world about their cultural work when it’s been appropriated,
and we’ll look at people creating in this new world of software and art
tools, especially at the ways creators are sharing and bringing new art
online and out into the wider world.</p>
