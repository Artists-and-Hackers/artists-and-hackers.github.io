## A

3m50s I sometimes like to say **what if roy lichtenstein and agnes martin had a baby that could code?**

- description of what her art practice looks like

5m15s smash my art with socal and del taco

5m40s description of SVG. technical description.

## B

7m10 ****"The question of how to balance aesthetics and criticality is an interesting question....". **At core I am very much a romantic and an expressionist because those are the pieces that moves me. ...    Color field painters..... interesting line between abstract expressionism and minimalism.** cut

8m40 I think focusing on transcendence as a goal is my critical work. that saying that computers aren't just machines for counting things .........is the core of my criticality.

9:10 If you make your art about race then it has to be about your relationship with white people....i'm not talking about that but about other things that are really important to me

9m52s what does it mean to move away from an i  ....i can describe my history of data art. i fell in love with data art as a way to to express myself with numbers.  LEE EXPLAINS DATA ART HERE? cut back to sarah describing how "we pretend those numbers are going to tell you something about those people"

13m50 computers can do other things. we just think about them as instrumental because that's how they're presented to us.

14m35s The Timeline of Neglect is a website that lists a number of books that I've acquired through various means....books that are gifts.... books that will solve an existential crisis....How do I visually reflect neglecting these books?

16m30s Livecode is a loose movement artistic genre I would say in which people make....music and visuals live using their computers and usually project the code. Different places tend to have slightly different flavors. I've found the UK has more rave-y dance focused. 1 or 2 visualists with the whole set. It's very clubby focused. In New York where I'm part of LiveCodeNYC it is definitely more of an arty artkid scene. The people come from the various tech masters' programs in New York....We tend to do shows in bars .....in Bushwick.

# C

 **The focus of livecode is really about making computing apprehensive, comprehensive. You can see the music and hear the music. See the visuals and the code to make the visuals. ......**

# D

**18m30 I became part of livecode and Codie, Kate Siccio.........We got along really well, so we ended up becoming friend.s she had done livecode in england, so she sort of brought livecode to new york, including ramsey nasser were part of this livecode thing. so i went to the meetings so i could see my friends and yell about compilers.**



a lot of people who do livecode like to write their own tools and i like compilers.

# E

**i'm interested in computer languages as languages. i was like, great. kate talked me into performing with her. you get to write your own tool, a compiler, to make visuals! i got sucked into it through the technical question, and i performed once and it blew my mind and it fell in love. i was so excited to be able to make the work i made, even though now i make videos that aren't from live shows,i think my approach is still from the live shows. doing the live shows is very much about what helped me get to (check wording here) today. i think the first we were codie, first kate and i, and then melanie loveless joined us, we're ia trio now. the first year we played i think we played 26 27 years the first year. every time we have a new show i make a new branch in my code. ....helped me level up my aesthetics and focus on what i want to do so that really formed me.**

Recording 2 [https://we.tl/t-U6z4IUsgsY](https://we.tl/t-U6z4IUsgsY)  

0m0s I basically fell in love with languages at SFPC......

**I first got into computer languages as an art form at SFPC the School For Poetic Computation. I was in the second full length class** (side note: Lee was in the 1st year as well, where he met Sarah. It was 2014!)**. Ramsey was there, one of our professors there, and he's now a good friend now and this is how i met him. He did a class on how computers take code and make it into things. I think that class was a huge turning point in regards to my relationship with computers. before that they were capricious gods like the greek gods......and if you typed the right thing maybe it would do what you want, maybe it wouldn't . i just had to appease the computer. and ramsey started this class, how does your file turn this file into code. CUT AROUND HERE? What I took from that: Computers made by idiots, just like me...it blew my mind. Esolangs, computer languages made to make a point. Computer languages made to make a point.**

2m40 Brainfuck. Whatever. It just adds statements to a bag then removes them. General mention of Esolangs.

3m I went directly from SFPC to Recurse center or hacker school then. .....I wrote a domain specific language.....

3m30s *****I really like to write tools i think. even at work i notice there's different kinds of engineers. And I notice I'm just a structural engineer, . ...I find it so fascinating how we put words together and how we put chunks of code together in our various files to communicate with the programmers who are goingto come later or ourselves.***...**the worst programmer is me 4 months ago.

4m5s ****i just really like being able to make my own tools, and so being able to do that for livecode is great. and i do i have visuals that are very different. a lot of other livecode visualists use one or two tools that other peolpe tend to like that are very easy to use . one of which is hydra by olivia jack, based on video synthesis and it's a great tool but a lot of the work that comes out of it looks similar.......

4m45s having made my own tool means that a lot of work looks like "Sarah"made it. like it's not certain. look ath those hard edge lines and 90s colors. so the tool is also a way to take ownership of what i'm doing in a deep way.

5m there's a criticiality **h**idden with that as well.

6m **The tool that I built that I use for livecode is called La Habra, which is named for the city that I grew up in fora  litle while in southern california when i was a kid.** and it was built in closure script, that compiles to javascript....lots of parentsis there. in teh case of my tool it runs in an electron app.

because it's a list i just make a picture by making a big list of everything that should be in it.

it's somewhat different from processing or p5.js....

7m40s *DESCRIBES LA HABRA IN somewhat techy detail.*

Aesthetically the look comes out of SVG and aeshtetically it tends to draw hard lines. Anything else is possible but it takes a bit more work.

9m40s Before I made La Habra I made p5bots a libarry to work with arduino. and that project is sort of why .......when you make tools for other people yo are making a committment to make that code work for other people. it's a bit rude to say i'm sorry it's not going to work on mac catalina.... you make a commitment to people that you're going to keep it working and grow a community around it and you're going to look at PR's (*LEE: "PR's Or PULL REQUESTS are online requests on the code-sharing website GitHub. When someone shares the code for their software, they may allow other folks to use and alter that code. Sometimes those folks that alter your code might want to share it back with you and even offer a suggestion to improve your code. Pull Requests are the way to do it."*

10m40s ..."I definitely did not want to do  that for art. i wanted to be able to change things because i wanted to change them. i wanted to break them and only have it matter to me. i only have so much time for the artand that's the flip side of a day job. ....if i made a tool for everyone else i'd have to spend a lot more time supporting peolpe and the community and i just didn't have that time.

**(LEE SHOULD MENTION SARAH'S MANIFESTO BRIEFLY HERE.  MAYBE READ THE POINTS?)**

11m40s **So one thing that I say in the 7 points of computer critical computer art is that computers like to say they're free from history. they're not and let's remind them of this fact....**But conceptually computing likes to present machines objective items not tainted by our human needs like biases and history. people talk about machine learning that they're biased because.....deliver the fairest most perfect thing, that's just not true. all the metaphors ....all of those are historically situated in a cold war positivist mathematically influenced culture. even the idea being object is the most perfect thing you can be. objectively is impossible. and so you should do things that counter the biases you know about. ...that goal is an ideal situated by

whole earth catalog......this whole fight we're having now that has dangerous consequences of twitter.....is situated in late california 70s .......it's not inherent in the machine.....

going back and showing the textures of historical image processing.....it puts into computing images the fact that there is a history there and it has texture and meaning.
