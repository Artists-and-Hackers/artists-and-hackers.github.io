Dinkins is a transmedia artist looking at artificial intelligence. She's interested in not just exploring these far reaching technologies as they intersect ideas of race, aging, gender, but also working toward equity and community sovereignty.



Originally a photographer, over time she began a career in marketing and advertising though eventually went back to photography when she found that ultimately unsatisfying. She saw her photographic work as a documentary practice and came to begin working with artificial intelligence (AI) in a similar context as she documented her interactions with the advanced robot Bina48.



She was driven by a desire to befriend it and find out the answer to the question "Who are your people?" Through the process of holding conversation with the robot she was disheartened to find that while the robot was representationally Black it had basic answers on race, flattening discussion. It triggered in Dinkins first some questions and later a desire to begin to construct her own AI systems that "felt whole... in terms of Blackness."



This led to Dinkins creating works with conversational agents. Her project Not The Only One (N'TOO) is an "ongoing experiment...an attempt to create a multigenerational memoir of a Black American family told from the perspective of an artificial intelligence of evolving intellect." Other works by Dinkins include online exhibits, interactive and immersive installations, driven by her desire to work with communities of color to co-create more equitable, values grounded social and technological ecosystems.
