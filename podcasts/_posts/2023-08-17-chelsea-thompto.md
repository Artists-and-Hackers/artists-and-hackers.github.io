This season we’ve partnered with the New Media Caucus, an international non-profit formed to promote the development and understanding of new media art. We’re interviewing five new media artists working today, both individually and at a live in-person event we held in February. This season of the podcast is supported by the National Endowment for the Arts grants for arts projects.

On today’s episode I’m speaking with artist Chelsea Thompto. I was looking forward to talking with her because in addition to working in code she’s also been active in sculpture and printmaking. I wanted to talk with her about code’s affordances for an artist. In other words, what potential ways of working are unlocked when you’re an artist who chooses to work with code as a medium? When she was creating sculptures, for example, she was designing systems for their creation, and this over time led her to thinking through ways she can leverage interactivity in her works: how to bring your audience into a relationship to relate to the work and to interface with it? And this is something that code in particular is uniquely suited for, where one can write code that directly integrates interactivity into one’s work, as sculpture, as software, as a website, among many other examples. 

Chelsea talked about her project [Transcode Manifesto](https://github.com/cthompto/Transcode-Manifesto), an always in progress manifesto. 

> Transcode takes up codes as an artistic material and as a trans methodology. While not only referring to computer code, transcode does view computer code as a material with immense potential in enacting the gesture of trans.

We also get into ideas of the handmade web, digital preservation, and teaching our values.
