In this season of the podcast we’re working in collaboration with the Engelberg Center on Innovation Law and Policy at NYU Law. In addition to our usual crop of artists and programmers we’re adding in legal scholars to help us unpack some of the thorny issues for those working in art and code as they unleash their work into the world. 

<br>

When you look for creative work online without any restrictions on what you can do with it, you’re looking for work that is part of what we call - the public domain. That's the term for creative works that are completely unrestricted for re-use.
 
<br>
 
We can think of the public domain as a common good. There is no copyright, no ownership by an individual or entity. Anyone may use the work without getting any permission or other approval. Works older than a particular time period are automatically in the public domain - we can think of Shakespeare’s work, or greek statues for example. But also works where the artist signed away their rights, or works where the copyright expired, and works where the artist specifically allows reuse or works that are not allowed to be copyrighted for various reasons. For example, a lot of US Government works are in the public domain. 

<br>

In this episode we speak with Brewster Kahle, the Founder and Chief Librarian of the Internet Archive, a nonprofit digital library in San Francisco, California. In the words of Brewster Kahle, the Internet Archive aims to be "the Library of Alexandria for the digital age." It holds millions of videos, software, books, images, concert recordings, and hundreds of billions of archived websites. 

<br>

We also speak with Amanda Levendowski, the Founding Director of the Intellectual Property and Information Policy Clinic at Georgetown University Law Center, on the doctrine of fair use and its reason for being and how artists can get legal support.

### Guests

<a href="https://brewster.kahle.org/">Brewster Kahle</a> is the founder and Digital Librarian of the Internet Archive, one of the largest libraries in the world. Soon after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he studied artificial intelligence, Kahle helped found the company Thinking Machines, a parallel supercomputer maker. In 1989, Kahle created the Internet's first publishing system called Wide Area Information Server (WAIS), later selling the company to AOL. In 1996, Kahle co-founded Alexa Internet, which helps catalog the Web, selling it to Amazon.com in 1999. The Internet Archive, which he founded in 1996, now preserves 99+ petabytes of data - the books, Web pages, music, television, and software of our cultural heritage, working with more than 400 library and university partners to create a digital library, accessible to all. 

<a href="https://www.levendowski.net/" class="nameTag">Amanda Levendowski</a> is an Associate Professor of Law and the founding Director of the Intellectual Property and Information Policy (iPIP) Clinic at Georgetown Law. Her clinical projects and research focus on developing practical approaches to novel legal problems by promoting social justice. She has been researching intellectual property and technology  for more than a decade. Her inaugural research series, the iPIP x Social Justice Quintet, used intellectual property laws creatively to promote social justice for cutting-edge technologies. To complement this work, she pursued the Technology Pedagogy Duo, which provides fresh pedagogical approaches to issues at the intersection of law and technology. Most recently, her research has focused on building out the Feminist Cyberlaw Series, consisting of several articles, an edited volume, and a book chapter that use an intersectional feminist lens to see how cyberlaws contribute to the oppression and liberation of marginalized people. She is also working on a biography of Barbara Ringer, the lead architect of the 1976 Copyright Act.
