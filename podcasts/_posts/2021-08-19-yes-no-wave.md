Almost 15 years old, Yes No Wave is part of a history of online record labels that sprang up to serve the people of Indonesia. With 270 million people Indonesia is the fourth largest nation in the world, after the US, and the island of Java is home to half of the Indonesian population. Indonesian music predates the historical record. The tribes of Indonesia have many different musical traditions and practices. And the music of indonesia is incredibly varied, from the orchestra-like traditional Gamelan music to the rise of metal and hardcore music and the ubiquitous javanese dangdut.



In the early 2000s as experimental musicians and bands came up in Indonesia they suffered from some of the same problems as bands all over the world: how to get their music out. Artist Wok The Rock began the net audio label Yes No Wave to put out the music of his friends.



Creative Commons is an open license for arts and culture. Formulated by a community of people in the early 2000s Creative Commons is both a non-profit organization and an international movement of folks dedicated to growing a community of free sharing of creative work and making that work available for sharing and remixing.



At this point billions of songs, photographs and other works are shared online with a creative commons license. This work is shared on websites like the Internet Archive and from its beginning Wok's record label Yes No Wave has been a part of this movement. He's distributed and shared hundreds of albums on the Internet Archive, Free Music Archive and his own websites.
