*Note: This episode acknowledges the existence of sex and includes intimate text written via machine learning.*

In episode 8 we spoke with artist Stephanie Dinkins on her projects Conversations with BINA-48 and Not The Only One. In Episode 9 we talked with artist Ryan Kuo and collaborator Tommy Martinez on Faith and BabyFaith. In today’s episode we’re speaking with LA-based artist Emily Martinez. Emily is a first generation Cuban immigrant and refugee. In their own words, they say they were raised by Miami, and they’ve been living in Los Angeles since 2012. They’ve worked with a number of collaborators, most recently with artist Ben Lerchin on a project they call [QueerAI](https://queer.ai/).

Emily has been building bots for many years, especially on the social media platform Twitter. Their project Meow Bot (@meowzzzzzzzzz) tweeted and retweeted and responded to posts about Ray Kurzweil, the technological 'singularity', accelerationism, Universal Basic Income, labor and the 'sharing economy,' among other subjects. The bot was immensely popular, and speculated about rampantly. It was even invited to present at an AI conference. But Emily never intervened, allowing Meow Bot to lead an autonomous existence. Meow Bot existed on the platform a bit less than two years when the Twitter API changed and the bot stopped functioning.

Jessica Garson is a Senior Developer Advocate at Twitter, as well as an educator, programmer and artist. Part of her work is to connect with developers to find out how they use the social media platform. Jessica describes bots as 'performing actions'. 

> For example, there are automated accounts that will post information about earthquakes if you live in San Francisco. I have a very close friend of mine who is blind and I often will post images without alt text and there’s a bot to remind me to add alt text to my images. There were vaccine bots. I actually got my vaccination appointment through TurboVax as did many New Yorkers. That’s something that’s really exciting.

Jessica speaks about some of the recent efforts made to better support those creating bots on the platform. 

In recent years, Emily has been working with the artist Ben Lerchin on QueerAI. QueerAI is "conversational AI agents for the advancement of new eroticisms." Emily and Ben create bots, conversational agents, and other experiments, and have organized workshops and created zines. 

One of Emily's recent projects is called [Unsupervised Pleasures](https://unsupervisedpleasures.com). 

> [Unsupervised Pleasures are] experiments in machine learning ft (mostly) Queer.ai, a language model trained on erotic literature, queer theatre, and an ethics of embodiment.

Unsupervised Pleasures came about as an offshoot of Emily's ML5.js fellowship during which they learned how to prep training data and train machine learning models such as GPT-2, an open source artificial intelligence model created by OpenAI. A goal of Emily's research was to study some of the bias inherent to GPT-2, which Emily decided to explore by fine tuning the model with small datasets and then studying the output. Some of the models they created include the works of Audre Lorde, Spinoza and an updated version 2 model of QueerAI.

One of the ongoing experiments Emily built with this newer model of Queer AI (v2) is Ultimate Fantasy, a collection of short stories, poems, and artworks that all begin with the prompt, "Let me tell you about my ultimate fantasy..."
