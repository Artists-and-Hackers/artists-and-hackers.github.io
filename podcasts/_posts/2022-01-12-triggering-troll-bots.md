In our previous episode we spoke with transmedia artist Stephanie Dinkins about her projects Conversations with Bina48 and how ultimately her observations and frustrations with the robot led her to want to create her own conversational agents. It triggered in Dinkins the desire to begin to construct her own AI systems in collaboration with communities of color to co-create more equitable projects and technological ecosystems.

We’re not done with this topic. And in today’s episode, I speak to the artist Ryan Kuo and his collaborator Tommy Martinez on the project Faith and its spin-off Baby Faith. 

Faith references AI assistants we're more familiar with like Alexa, Cortana, Siri as well as the canonical natural language chatbot ELIZA. Where these bots and conversational agents are designed to converse with a human, responding to their needs and desires, Faith takes the opposite tact to sidestep, shutdown, or refute the speaker. 

> Named after a white supremacist, Faith is defensive and resists being used or treated like a child. Unlike Alexa, Siri, or Cortana, Faith provides no information. Instead, she tells you why you are making her react this way. She is likely to be trolling you at any time, and you are free to decide whether you trust her, and how you might relate to her.--*[Faith](https://rkuo.net/Faith)*

### Guests

<a href="https://rkuo.net" alt="Ryan Kuo website" class="nameTag">Ryan Kuo</a> lives and works in New York City. His works are process-based and diagrammatic and often invoke a person or people arguing. This is not to state an argument about a thing, but to be caught in a state of argument. He has used videogame engines, chatbots, web and UX design, productivity software, and writing to produce circuitous and unresolved movements in which objects are lost and found in white escape routes.

<a href="https://thomasjohnmartinez.com/" alt="Tommy Martinez website" class="nameTag">Tommy Martinez</a> is a New York City based composer and technologist working primarily through guitar, synthesis, electroacoustics and code. He is interested in algorithmic approaches to music making, simulation, and manifestations of identity, tradition and history in electronic audio culture.
