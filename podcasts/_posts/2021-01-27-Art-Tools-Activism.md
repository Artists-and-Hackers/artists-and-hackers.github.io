Our guests are artist Grayson Earle, the collaborative team who made [White Collar Crime Zones](https://whitecollar.thenewinquiry.com/) (Brian Clifton, Francis Tseng, Sam Lavigne), and artist and organizer Ann Haeyoung.

<br>

In the [Software for Artists Book: Building Better Realities](https://pioneerworks.org/publishing/software-for-artists-book/), Grayson says:

<br>

> [I'm] not so shy about the distinctions, like, “Is it art? Is it activism?” I think these things are kind of funny constructions. For me it’s never a question of, “Is it art?” But, what does it afford us to call something art that we might be more comfortable calling activism?

<br>

Grayson has been building the Counter-Productivity Suite, a series of tools for workers in crisis. These tools are meant to aid striking workels and to connect their plight to historical labor history.

<br>

Grayson points out that the root of the word *sabotage* is an old French word for shoe forms: *sabot*. He describes how  peasants arrived in Industrial Paris to work in factories and experienced unfair labor conditions. The story goes that they resorted to disrupting the means of production, at times by throwing their wooden shoes into the machinery. In one of his current tools, he considers what form this shoe could take in the current era.

<br>

We also speak with the team behind [White Collar Crime Zones](https://whitecollar.thenewinquiry.com/), Brian Clifton, Francis Tseng and Sam Lavigne. White Collar Crime Risk Zones uses machine learning to predict where financial crimes are mostly likely to occur across the US. It is a commentary on predictive policing and algorithmic bias.

<br>

Sam believes art has the power to clarify, to make clear issues of inequity. Francis holds out hope that artists building tools and technology can subvert power, though he warns us we should be ready to abandon our tools at any time. And Brian identifies as a former artist and current data scientist, someone that knows how data works and can wield and deploy data sets.

<br>

Ann Haeyoung takes a different approach to considering art and activism. She creates sculpture and performance work, which she considers to be a separate process from her work as an activist and organizer and tech worker. She brings this past and current experience to bear as her work spotlights issues of identity and inequity arising from corporatized technology.
