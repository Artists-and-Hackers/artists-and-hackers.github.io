Our guests for the program were Chelsea Thompto, KT Duffy, Sue Huang and Rashin Fahandej. A fifth artist, SHAWNÉ MICHAELAIN HOLLOWAY wasn’t available for the live recording but she is individually interviewed in episode 16, and each of the other artists were also individually interviewed so be sure to check those episodes out as well.

This season we’ve partnered with the New Media Caucus, an international non-profit formed to promote the development and understanding of new media art. This season of the podcast is supported by the National Endowment for the Arts grants for arts projects.

This special live recording was held in February 2023 on location at Flux Factory in Queens, New York City.

### Guests

<a href="https://www.chelseathompto.com/" class="nameTag">Chelsea Thompto</a> is a transdisciplinary artist and educator working at the intersections of art, trans studies, and technology. Her research based studio practice spans a variety of media which often include code, video, sound, writing, and sculpture and her work has been shown nationally and internationally. Born and raised in Iowa, she has spent most of her life between the Midwest and California and she’s an incoming Assistant Professor of Creative Technologies at Virginia Tech. She is currently a member of the Year 9 [NEW INC](https://www.newinc.org/members) cohort in the Art & Code track, and serves on the editorial board of the  [Media-N: Journal of the New Media Caucus](https://iopn.library.illinois.edu/journals/median). She received an MFA in 4D Art and an MA in Gender and Women's Studies from the University of Wisconsin Madison.

<a href="http://ktduffyprojects.com/" class="nameTag">KT Duffy</a> is a new media artist from Chicago’s southwest side and is currently an Assistant Professor in Art, Technology, and Culture at the University of Oklahoma. They received their MFA in Interdisciplinary Art from the Maryland Institute College of Art. They live between Chicago, IL, and Norman, OK, with their partners and dogs. 

Duffy conjures entities into existence via code-based processes and digital fabrication. As a Neurodivergent-NonBinary person, the normative modalities of learning and making were not designed for them. To move through these structures, they made their own systems, glitching and patching and breaking the entanglements of binary logic. Their work manifests infinite possibility, translating the immeasurable interconnection of transcendent sentience, and examining the impending demise of binary systems.

<a href="https://www.sue-huang.com/" class="nameTag">Sue Huang</a> is a new media and installation artist whose work addresses collective experience. Her current projects explore ecological intimacies, human and nonhuman relations, and speculative futures. She has exhibited nationally and internationally including at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), Los Angeles; the Contemporary Arts Center (CAC) in Cincinnati; Rhizome; ISEA; Ars Electronica; and the Beall Center for Art + Technology. She’s been artist in residence at Lower Manhattan Cultural Council (LMCC), the Studios at MASS MoCA , and at Cherry Street Pier.

<a href="http://www.rashinfahandej.com/" class="nameTag">Rashin Fahandej</a> is an Iranian-American futurist, immersive storyteller, and cultural activist. Fahandej’s artistic initiatives are multiyear experimental laboratories for collective radical reimaginations of social systems, using counter-narratives of care and community co-creation to design equitable futures. Her projects center on marginalized voices and the role of media, technology, and public collaboration in generating emotional connections to drive social change.
