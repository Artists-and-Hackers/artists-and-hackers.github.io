In this season of the podcast we’re working with the Engelberg Center on Innovation Law and Policy at NYU Law. In addition to our usual crop of artists and programmers we’re adding in legal scholars to help us unpack some of the thorny issues for those working in art and code as they unleash their work into the world. We’ll also talk to communities aiming to alter the context of how their cultural work is presented. Who can remix? What does the law have to do with cultural appropriation? How are artists hacking copyright? Those are a few of the area we’ll get into. 


<br>

This episode features conversations with Michael Weinberg, the Executive Director of the Engelberg Center on Innovation Law and Policy at NYU School of Law. We also speak with computer scientist, game designer and media artist Ramsey Nasser on the Anti-Capitalist Software License. Finally, we join some of the organizers from the ml5.js programming library, which aims to make "machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists, creative coders, and students."
