In this episode we're talking about the <a href="http://iyaporepository.org/" alt="Iyapo Repository" class="nameTag">Iyapo Repository</a>, a digital resource library that's built to preserve artifacts ensuring the history and legacies of people of African descent. To set that up we've got to talk about Afrofuturism.

<br>

Afrofuturism is a term coined by Mark Dery in 1993 to refer to the intersection of African diaspora culture with technology and science fiction. It's a cultural movement where artists, designers and musicians were inspired by visions of the future, creating a new spectacular art that spoke to a new Afrocentric vision. 

<br>

Afrofuturism is not a singular vision but a branching philosophical and aesthetic project with many approaches in every art form and many standout examples. Afrofuturism has also been critiqued for an emphasis on technological determinism, kitchy space aesthetics and at times the exclusion of women and queer voices. But there's been an evolution.

<br>

In 2013 Rhizome published artist Martine Syms's The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto.

> The imaginative challenge that awaits any Mundane Afrofuturist author who accepts that this is it: Earth is all we have. What will we do with it? *--excerpt from [The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto](https://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/dec/17/mundane-afrofuturist-manifesto/)*

<br>

And one person at the forefront of this radical reimagining is Ayodamola Tanimowo Okunseinde or Ayo for short. Ayo prefers the term *Reclamation* to describe the work he's engaged in. He's co-creator and producer of the Iyapo repository with Salome Asega. It's a resource library for the future, founded to collect and preserve artifacts to ensure the history and legacy of people of African descent. The project is named for Lilith Iyapo, a character in Octavia Butler's Xenogenesis series, the  last remaining human left to straddle two complex worlds. 

<br>

> Iyapo Repository offers opportunities for people of African descent to generate and build technological cultural artifacts of their future. The project is situated between physical and digital spaces, between the present and the future. It asks us to reimagine notions of race, identity and culture through technological artifacts as they travel through time and place. *--[Iyapo Repository](http://iyaporepository.org/)*
